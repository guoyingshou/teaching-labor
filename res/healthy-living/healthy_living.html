        <strong>Don't listen to the negative comments of others.</strong>  This will only
        prevent you from feeling happy about yourself.  Keeping this in mind, 
        help out your community as well; it feels <em>good</em>!  Examples of this include
        keeping your community clean, helping an elderly neighbor, or even holding 
        the door for a stranger.  Sometimes it's the <em>simple</em> things in life that stand
        out the <em>most</em>.

        Ever wanted to go skydiving?  Para sailing?  Bungee jumping?  Well, then <strong>go ahead!
        </strong> Make a list of 25 things you want to do, and gradually, make them happen.  Also, 
        whenever a new opportunity arises, <em>never</em> let it slip between your fingers.

        Whenever you exercise, don't you just feel... <em>good</em>?  Well, then keep working
        out on a continual basis; it's a proven fact: <strong>those that are <em>healthier</em>
        are <em>happier</em></strong>.  Whether it's a jog around the track, a walk around the block, or
        a yoga class down the street, be physically active... and <strong>avoid junk food</strong>!

        Whenever you come into contact with people, whether it be in conversation, or a quick
        walk by, you are constantly judging them.  Well guess what, they are also judging
        <strong>you</strong>.  When approached by a smile, people feel much more at ease as well
        as relaxed.  Greet everyone with a simple "hi."  This will give everyone a <em>simple</em>, 
        yet <em>positive</em> first impression of you.
