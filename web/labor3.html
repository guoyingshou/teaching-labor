                    In the Fall of 2014, we will launch a new Massive
                    Open Online Course (MOOC)
                    called <strong>Teaching Labor</strong>, where a group of
                    teachers, students, activists, and interested individuals
                    will come together to study the history of the working
                    class and labor movement, and develop methods for
                    incorporating these ideas into our schools and clasrooms.

                    One percent of the nation owns a third of the wealth.
                    The rest of the wealth is distributed in such a way as
                    to turn those in the 99 percent against one another:
                    small property owners against the propertyless, black
                    against white, native-born against foreign-born,
                    intellectuals and professionals against the uneducated
                    and the unskilled.<br>
