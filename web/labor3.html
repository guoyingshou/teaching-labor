                    One percent of the nation owns a third of the wealth.
                    The rest of the wealth is distributed in such a way as
                    to turn those in the 99 percent against one another:
                    small property owners against the propertyless, black
                    against white, native-born against foreign-born,
                    intellectuals and professionals against the uneducated
