            "One percent of the nation owns a third of the wealth.
            The rest of the wealth is distributed in such a way as
            to turn those in the 99 percent against one another:
            small property owners against the propertyless, black
            against white, native-born against foreign-born,
            intellectuals and professionals against the uneducated
            and the unskilled."
        </h3>

            In the Fall of 2014, we will launch a new Massive
            Open Online Course (MOOC)
            called <strong>Teaching Labor</strong>, where a group of
            teachers, students, activists, and interested individuals
            will come together to study the history of the working
            class and labor movement, and develop methods for
            incorporating these ideas into our schools and clasrooms.
